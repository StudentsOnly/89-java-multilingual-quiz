## Exercise: Multilingual Quiz 

### Instructions:

In this exercise, you will create a Java program for a multilingual quiz application using Locale and ResourceBundle to present questions in different languages. Follow the steps below:

1.	Create a new Java project named MultilingualQuizApp.
2.	Inside the project, create a class named QuizService that will be responsible for managing the quiz questions and presenting them in different languages. This class should have methods to get questions and answers in different languages.
3.	Implement a ResourceBundle for each supported language (e.g., English, Spanish, German). Define the quiz questions and answers in the respective language properties files (e.g., quiz.properties, quiz_es_ES.properties, quiz_ge_GE.properties).
4.	In the QuizService class, use Locale and ResourceBundle to load the appropriate language bundle and retrieve quiz questions and answers.
5.	Create a Main class that demonstrates the usage of the QuizService. Create instances of QuizService and display quiz questions and answers in different languages.
